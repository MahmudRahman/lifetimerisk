# Modeling the lifetime risk 

This project contains R code to model the lifetime risk using pseudo-observations. We also share code used in our simulation study, including R code to simulate semi-competing risks data under cause-specific hazards and subdistribution hazards frameworks, SAS code to fit a Fine-Gray model for the cumulative incidence function and predict the lifetime risk, and Stata code to fit a flexible parametric model for the cumulative incidence function and predict the lifetime risk.

pseudo_ltr_function.R
```
This R code derives the lifetime risk at a given timepoint and derives pseudo-observations of the lifetime 
risk with the jackknife approach. Requires the Rcpp package to run pseudo_ltr_cpp.cpp code.

One could alternatively use the ETM package to derive the lifetime risk, and derive pseudo-observations 
from this quantity - results will be identical if the ETM package is used correctly.
